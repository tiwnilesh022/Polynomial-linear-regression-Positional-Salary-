    "### Advantages of using Polynomial Regression:\n",
    "- Polynomial provides the best approximation of the relationship between the dependent and independent variable.\n",
    "- A Broad range of function can be fit under it.\n",
    "- Polynomial basically fits a wide range of curvature.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages of using Polynomial Regression:\n",
    "- The presence of one or two outliers in the data can seriously affect the results of the nonlinear analysis.\n",
    "- These are too sensitive to the outliers.\n",
    "- In addition, there are unfortunately fewer model validation tools for the detection of outliers in nonlinear regression than there are for linear regression."
